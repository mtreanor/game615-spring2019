      <h2 class="mt-6">Description</h2>
      <p>First off, name your Unity project "exercise03".</p>
      <p>
        For this assignment, you should complete the <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial">official Unity "Roll a Ball" tutorial</a>.
        This tutorial does a good job of sumarizing what we've covered so far in class,
        and should be a good way to confirm you are understanding the basics of
        using Unity. It will also take several hours, so make sure you give yourself time to get it done this week.
      </p>
      <p>
        In class, we also introduced <a href="http://poly.google.com">Google Poly</a>. So, to make
        your version of the Roll a ball tutorial more interesting, download a model
        from Google Poly, and have it roll around! To do this, you will need to do the following steps:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Import the model into your game by placing it your Unity project's Assets folder
            (make sure you copy everything from the zip file)
          </li>
          <li>
            Make it so that the model's center point (or origin) is the actual center of the model.
            If you click on the model in your scene, and the movement tool is not centered in your
            model, you will need to do the following:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Create an empty game object</li>
            <li>Move the model so that the model's center is placed exactly where the empty game object is</li>
            <li>In the Hierarchy, select the model, and click and drag it onto the empty game object in the list</li>
            <li>Now, give the empty game object a name, and when you click on it in the Hierarchy, the tool should appear at the center of the model</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Give your model (or the parent game object from above) a SphereCollider component</li>
          <li>Now, everything the tutorial tells you to do the ball, should be done to this game object</li>
          <li>In the end, your model should roll around and it should look hilarious!</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <div class="container pb-5">
      <h2 class="mt-6">Building your Project for the Web</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open the Build Settings (File > Build Settings...)</li>
          <li>Click the Add Open Scenes button</li>
          <li>Select "WebGL" and then click the "Switch Platform" button</li>
          <li>Click the "Build" button</li>
          <li>
            When it asks you where you want to put your build, create a folder titled "web" in your exercise03 folder.
            Once you do this, it will take several minutes to build your game.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container pb-5">
      <h2 class="mt-6">Submission</h2>
      <p>
        Submit your project to github. Make sure your Unity project is titled "exercise03"
        and located in the "exercises" folder of your local github repository. To push it up
        to github, open Github Desktop, commit your changes (you need to enter a comment in the field on the bottom left of the screen),
        and click the "Push" button near the top middle of the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        If everything worked, you should be able to play your game by going to:<br>
        <br>
        http://(your git username).github.io/game615-spring2019/exercises/exercise03/web
