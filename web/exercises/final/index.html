      <h2 class="mt-6">Description</h2>
      <p>
        The final project is for you to create a complete (small) game. Where
        the weekly exercises were intended to give you experience and practice
        with the technical topics in the course, the final project should be a
        complete, tuned, fun and relatively good-looking game that you could
        give to a stranger and it would be reasonable to expect that they would enjoy
        their experience (that’s harder than it sounds!).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Also, have your game either explore a concept (social, political, etc.),
        or at least have some sort of story (even if it is a small one).</b>
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-5">What I Mean by a *Complete* Game</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>A start screen/menu (this can be as simple as your title and a “click to begin” button</li>
          <li>Something that ends the gameplay and brings the player back to the main menu. Usually there would be a way to win, and a way to lose </li>
          <li>During gameplay, there should be no way to “get stuck”</li>
          <li>During gameplay, your world should be bounded (no falling off of cliffs forever, or flying off into infinity)</li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Unity+audio">Audio?</a>
          </li>
          <li>Finally, try your best to get rid of anything that isn’t directly
            adding positively to the gameplay experience. This means that there
            shouldn’t be unnecessary long corridors, or hard to find collectables,
            etc.
          </li>
        </ul>

                <li>
                  A detailed plan for the game. This will involve describing all of the following components:

                    <li>Gameplay description (what is your “core mechanic”</li>

                  <ol>
                    <li>the “low-bar “of you will create (this should still be a “complete game”)</li>
                    <li>a target that you expect to get done</li>
                    <li>a desired high-bar if things go exceptionally well. Plan these out carefully, so that you can definitely achieve the first goal, and likely hit the second</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  A timeline of what you need to accomplish and by when to complete your game on time. Look at the personal schedules, your classes and other projects, and plan accordingly.
                </li>
                <p>
                  Be sure to spend time on this. The document should be 2-3 pages (though there is no minimum/maximum).
                </p>
                <p>We will review this in person together in our one on one meetings during class.</p>

                In class, we will identify areas that you should spend time improving, including bugs, and gameplay features.

              <p>
                Additionally, create one or more of the following and submit it along with your project files to your GitHub repository:
                <ul>
                  <li>A “one pager” where you put a description of your game and some representative screenshots (think of it like an ad for your game)</li>
                  <li>A simple trailer that shows gameplay</li>
                  <li>A simple website that describes your game with images</li>

      <h2 class="mt-6">Submission</h2>
      <p>
        Submit your project to github. Make sure your Unity project is titled "final"
        and located in the "exercises" folder of your local github repository. To push it up
        to github, open Github Desktop, commit your changes (you need to enter a comment in the field on the bottom left of the screen),
        and click the "Push origin" button near the top middle of the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        If everything worked, you should be able to play your game by going to:<br>
        <br>
        http://(your git username).github.io/game615-spring2019/exercises/final/web
      </p>
      <p>
        If exporting your game to WebGL doesn't work, build your game for either Mac or <picture>
        and attempt to upload that to GitHub in your Assets folder. If your game
        is too large to upload, include a file to a link to download the game (you can just put it on Google Drive, Dropbox, or some other such platform).
