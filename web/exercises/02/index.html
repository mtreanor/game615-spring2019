      <h2 class="mt-6">Description</h2>
      <p>First off, name your Unity project "exercise02".</p>
      <p>
        Modify the sample code to make something more interesting! We don't know
        <i>too much</i> yet, so really challenge yourself to make something
        compelling out of what we've covered so far.
        <ul>
          <li>Arranging shapes to knock eachother over</li>
          <li>Launching things on fulcrum like things</li>
          <li>Using custom colors</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        The sample code has A LOT of new material in it. As part of this
        assignment, it is expected that you have carefully read through the code
        and tried to follow how it works as best as you can. Please come to
        office hours if you want any additional explainations. The two main
        files you should look at are:
        <ul>
          <li>LaunchScript.cs</li>
          <li>RingScript.cs</li>
        </ul>
        You can ignore most of the other files. NOTE: The '.meta' files are used
        by Unity, and while necessary to make the game run, intended for
        developers to read.
      </p>

    <div class="container pb-5">
      <h2 class="mt-6">Getting the Sample Project Loaded into Your Project</h2>
      <p>
        To integrate the project into another Unity project, download and import the .unitypackage file located at the "CODE" link below.
        In your own Unity project, go to Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container pb-5">
      <h2 class="mt-6">Building your Project</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open the Build Settings (File > Build Settings...)</li>
          <li>Click the Add Open Scenes button</li>
          <li>Select "WebGL" and then click the "Switch Platform" button</li>
          <li>Click the "Build" button</li>
          <li>
            When it asks you where you want to put your build, create a folder titled "web" in your exercise02 folder.
            Once you do this, it will take several minutes to build your game.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container pb-5">
      <h2 class="mt-6">Submission</h2>
      <p>
        Submit your project to github. Make sure your Unity project is titled "exercise2"
        and located in the "exercises" folder of your local github repository. To push it up
        to github, open Github Desktop, commit your changes (you need to enter a comment in the field on the bottom left of the screen),
        and click the "Push" button near the top middle of the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        If everything worked, you should be able to play your game by going to:<br>
