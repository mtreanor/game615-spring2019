      <h2 class="mt-6">Description</h2>
      <p>
        We’ve been making a lot of cool demos, but it is time to make a <i>complete</i> (see below)
        game. Given how little time we have, you should limit your ambition and keep your game
        small (and likely short). While there are no official requirements for what
        type of game you make, it is expected that you demonstrate knowledge of the
        concepts and techniques that we have covered in class.
      </p>
      <p>
        The midterm is designed so that you can attempt to make something at whatever
        skill level you feel you are at. I recommend trying to make something along the lines of what you already
        worked on with the exercises: simple physics game (easiest), flight simulator (intermediate),
        platformer (intermediate), top down simulation/RTS game (hard). Remember
        to look at the sample code from class.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-5">What I Mean by a *Complete* Game</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>A start screen/menu (this can be as simple as your title and a “click to begin” button</li>
          <li>Something that ends the gameplay and brings the player back to the main menu. Usually there would be a way to win, and a way to lose </li>
          <li>During gameplay, there should be no way to “get stuck”</li>
          <li>During gameplay, your world should be bounded (no falling off of cliffs forever, or flying off into infinity)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Unity+audio">Audio?</a></li>
          <li>Finally, try your best to get rid of anything that isn’t directly adding positively to the gameplay experience. This means that there shouldn’t be unnecessary long corridors, or hard to find collectables, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>

      <h2 class="mt-6">Building your Project for the Web</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open the Build Settings (File > Build Settings...)</li>
          <li>Click the Add Open Scenes button</li>
          <li>Select "WebGL" and then click the "Switch Platform" button</li>
          <li>Click the "Build" button</li>
          <li>
            When it asks you where you want to put your build, create a folder titled "web" in your midterm folder.
            Once you do this, it will take several minutes to build your game.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container pb-5">
      <h2 class="mt-6">Submission</h2>
      <p>
        Submit your project to github. Make sure your Unity project is titled "midterm"
        and located in the "exercises" folder of your local github repository. To push it up
        to github, open Github Desktop, commit your changes (you need to enter a comment in the field on the bottom left of the screen),
        and click the "Push origin" button near the top middle of the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        If everything worked, you should be able to play your game by going to:<br>
        <br>
        http://(your git username).github.io/game615-spring2019/exercises/midterm/web
